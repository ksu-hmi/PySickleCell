# PySickleCell
**Project Description**:Sickle Cell Disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder that cause red blood cells to become misshapen and break down. The disorder commonly found in the African American community affecting them by causing pain crisis, stroke, and kidney disease. The development of this program would assist patients and their families with early detection of acute physiological deterioration leading to organ failure is not always manageable for individuals with Sickle Cell Disease (SCD). This system would firstly use machine learning techniques that allow for prediction of organ failure from physio markers may enable earlier identification, treatment, and potentially reduce mortality. The software would secondly, have the capability to predict the patients’ signs and symptoms of organ failure over a period for a treatment plan to decline mortality rate for SCD. The software will lastly, class with two functions to read in a text file with a DNA sequence and returns the amino acid sequence. Translates each codon, only used Isoleucine, Leucine, Valine,Phenylalanine, methionine and X for any other in order to find out which gene`s will cause sickle cell. 

**Goal**:

The goal for this project is to help predict the patients’ signs and symptoms of organ failure over a period for a treatment plan to decline mortality rate for SCD. Sickle Cell Disease isn`t a curable disease yet and treatment can help with fighting the disease. Our goal is to help this population with a pain management or even longer-term death. Our software will help healthcare officials understand the disease better to fight the disease for a cure one day.
